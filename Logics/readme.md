1. A logic learnt during making prime no. program that there can not be any no.greater than n/2 that can completely divide n except n ; as n/2 divides it by 2 completely and n divides it by 1 completely bw them no integer exits hence no number exist bw them which completely divide n; (also n/2 ko 2 prime no. aaye tab bhi shi se program chle isliye bhi kiya tha ) "Learn to Build the Logic with Focus" Logic reimplented gath bandh lo ki agar kisi bhi number se uski alag alag digits lena ho to us no ko modulo by 10 krne se ek ek digit hath me ati jaegi or yad rkha jaye last digit jo ki obvisouly divide nhi hogi to vhi digit as a remainder aa jaegi and then us no. ko divide by 10 krdo ushi loop me taki ab second last digit mile and that's it this logic solves many problems
2. When we divide any no. by 100 we get remainder from 0 to 99 in the same way when we get the divide any no by 10 we get remainder from 0 to 9 and if want to get from 1 to 10 or 1 to 100 then simply add one .
Yes, it is true that when dividing any integer \(a\) by a positive integer \(b\), the remainder \(r\) will be between \(\text{0}\) and \(b-\text{1}\) inclusive, i.e., \(\boxed{\text{0}\le r\le b-\text{1}}\).

3. C can also convert int to float like 22 to 22.0
